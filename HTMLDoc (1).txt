CSS

1. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
   CSS  describes the way of styling of the HTML Document and how to display the HTML elements

2.	CSS Syntax :

	p {
		color: red;
		text-align: center;
	} 

	Here p is a selector and {} part is declaration

	color is property and red is value
	
3. Three Ways to Insert CSS

	External style sheet : 
	With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css">
	
	Internal style sheet:
	An internal style sheet may be used if one single page has a unique style
	
		<style>
		h1 {
			color: maroon;
			margin-left: 40px;
		} 
		</style>

	Inline style: 
	An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.
	<h1 style="color:blue;margin-left:30px;">This is a heading</h1>
